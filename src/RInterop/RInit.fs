/// When set to 'true' before the R engine is initialized, the initialization
/// will set the 'R_CStackLimit' variable to -1 (which disables stack checking
/// in the R engine and makes it possible to call R engine from multiple threads

/// This should not generally be done, but it is hard to avoid in a type provider
/// called by the F# compiler and engine called by user code.
///
/// When this is *not* done, the R provider will occasionally report 
/// "Error: C stack usage is too close to the limit" when it is called from 
/// another thread (not concurrently, just from another thread than previously).
